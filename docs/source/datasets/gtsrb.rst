GTSRB
=====

Overview
--------

The German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) is an image classification
dataset with 43 traffic sign classes. The official final distribution has 39,209
training images and 12,630 test images, for 51,839 images in total. There is no
validation split. Labels retain the benchmark's integer class IDs, 0 through 42;
the ``ClassLabel`` names are the corresponding numeric strings.

The original images are PPM files with variable width and height. They are
decoded as RGB without resizing, cropping, padding, or normalization. The
dataset's cache stores them as PNG while preserving their pixels and dimensions.

The training ZIP includes per-class annotation CSVs. The test image ZIP includes
image annotations without labels; labels come from the separate official test
ground-truth ZIP. The builder joins the two test tables by filename. Width,
height, and sign-region coordinates are checked against the source data during
loading but are not exposed as columns, following the image classification
builders' ``image``/``label`` schema.

Data Structure
--------------

Each example has these fields:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 20 60

   * - Key
     - Type
     - Description
   * - ``image``
     - ``PIL.Image.Image``
     - Original-size RGB traffic sign image
   * - ``label``
     - int
     - Official class ID, 0 through 42

Usage Example
-------------

.. code-block:: python

   from stable_datasets.images import GTSRB

   train = GTSRB(split="train")
   test = GTSRB(split="test")

   print(len(train))  # 39209
   print(len(test))   # 12630

   sample = train[0]
   print(sample.keys())
   print(sample["image"].size)
   print(sample["label"])

state a license suitable for the dataset license field, so it is left empty.
